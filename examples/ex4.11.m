Exams occur next week and the week after and then I have a >3 month break before classes resume. As part of my exam revision, I decided to metaphorically kill two birds with one stone by writing a webpage that solves a type of problem that'll appear in the exam of one of my maths subjects. It 'kills two birds with one stone' by allowing me to revise what I learnt in that JS/HTML class whilst also providing me with something that I can use to check my working in the exam, as with that method it's easy to make a minor arithmetic error that'll screw up all subsequent calculations.
